## How it all started

You know that feeling when you find something so cool, you have to tell someone? That was me a few days back. My first instinct? grab a few screenshots, head straight to Likedin and hit post.

But something felt off. The post went live, got a few likes, and then... it disappeared into the endless scroll. That's when it hit me: what was I really trying to achieve here? A LinkedIn post has a shelf life of about 24 hours before it becomes digital dust. If someone needed this information next week, next month, or next year, how would they find it? The answer was clear: they wouldn't.

## The Search For Something Better

After days of hopping between platforms, I realized I needed something structured, flexible, and more findable in this vast internet. I started where evryone does - popular blogging platforms. They were polished, powerful, easy to use, packed with features like SEO optimization, clean typography and much more.

Some of them are:
- Medium

- Dev.to
- Hashnode
- Substack

Somewhere along the way, the goal shifted. I no longer wanted the best blog - I wanted my blog (even if it was a simple one).

**Self-Hostable Solutions:**
- Ghost
- WordPress
- Static site generators (Jekyll, Hugo, Gatsby)

## Finding Astro

The long search led me to [Astro](https://astro.build/)—a modern framework (static site generator) that generates content from MDX. The search continued, and I finally found the [astro-erudite](https://github.com/jktrn/astro-erudite) repository, which was a lifesaver for many people like me.

After a few sleepless nights, I customized it according to my own needs, learning Tailwind and Astro along the way.

## Building Your Own Blog

Honestly, as I'm a backend guy and wanted a fast solution, I picked this template as a good starting point. But you have options:

### Option 1: Use a Template
- Find a template that matches your style (like astro-erudite)
- Customize it to your needs
- Fast and efficient if you want to get started quickly

### Option 2: Build from Scratch
- Start with Astro, Next.js, or any framework you prefer
- Full control over design and functionality
- More time-consuming but completely yours

### Option 3: Use a CMS
- Ghost, WordPress, or similar platforms
- Good if you want a traditional blog with admin panel
- Less customization but easier content management

## Hosting Options

Now comes the big question: How are you going to host it?

I went with **Cloudflare Pages**, which offers generous rate limits and free hosting. But you have several great options:

- **Cloudflare Pages** - Free, fast, generous limits
- **Vercel** - Great developer experience, free tier
- **Netlify** - Easy deployment, free tier available
- **GitHub Pages** - Free for public repos
- **Self-hosting** - Full control (I'm planning to move to this soon)

All of these platforms offer free tiers that are more than enough for a personal blog.

## The Result

So yeah, finally here's the first version after sleepless nights. If you find some bugs here and there, kindly drop an email to [theinfinull@gmail.com](mailto:theinfinull@gmail.com).

Thanks for reading this!

*P.S. If you're thinking about starting your own blog, just do it. Pick a template, customize it, deploy it, and start writing. The best time to start was yesterday, the second best time is now.* ☺️
