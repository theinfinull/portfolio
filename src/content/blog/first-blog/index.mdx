# Intro

Hey everyone, I'm Infinull, a Software Developer. If you're curious to know more about me, you can find that [here](/about).

**I've decided to give blogging a shot.**

In my day-to-day life, there a lot of stuff which I stumble across. This blog is a place to capture a few of them and make it public. The entire motive is to share stuff that might actually help somebody out there. (or atleast make em laugh)

# The (Un)Plan

<div class="max-w-xs mx-auto">

</div>

I honestly have no idea how this will evolve over time. It might change shape, tone or direction - and that's okay. What I do know is that I'd rather build, break and learn stuff in public than let it sit in a private draft forever. Whether it's a weird bug that ruined my sleep, a tool which saved me hours, or a random project idea which never saw the light of day - If i feel like sharing it, It'll be here.

No promises, no plans, just a developer sharing some stuff.

# Outro

So yeah - Welcome. Stick around, explore, and hopefully you'll find some cool stuff here. If you wanna know the entire backstory behind the blog, kindly checkout [this one](/blog/story-behind-this-blog).

**Stay tuned. See ya around 👋🏻**
